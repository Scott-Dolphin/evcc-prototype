                <p>
                    East Valley Children's Choir (EVCC) is a community outreach ministry of Evangelical Formosan Church of East Valley (EFC-EV). It's a Christ-centered educational organization serving the communities in east San Gabriel Valley, California. Its mission is to provide a nurturing environment for the local community’s children to learn music, to explore their musical talents and to enjoy the musical arts in a choir setting. An equally important role of EVCC is to encourage the growth of self-discipline, responsibility, teamwork, and self-confidence.                  </p>

                <h1>Choir History</h1>
                <p>
                East Valley Children’s Choir (EVCC) was founded in 1990 by Evangelical Formosan Church of East Valley as part of our church’s community service ministry. The primary goal of EVCC is to provide an environment for the community’s children to learn music, improve on musical talents and to experience the joy of singing in a choir together.  An equally important aspect of the choir is the nurturing and growth of discipline, responsibility, teamwork, and self-confidence.

                At 2019 there was over 100 members sectioned into Chamber, Concert, Junior, Apprentice and Preparatory groups. The choir practices every Sunday afternoon at Evangelical Formosan Church in Walnut.

                The choir had been closed for almost 2 and half years for the pandemic. Now we reopen to serve the community. Welcome the 1st to 12th graders to join with us to enjoy the singing again. Please sign up and invite your friends to join, too. We can’t wait to sing with you.
