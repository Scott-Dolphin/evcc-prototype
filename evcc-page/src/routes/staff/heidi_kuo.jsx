                Heidi Kuo was born and raised in Taiwan. She moved to the US with her family 
                during her high school years. She is fluent in Mandarin and English. After 
                graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Vocal Performance from Azusa Pacific 
                University in 2006, she taught choir with EVCC for three years. She resigned 
                from the teaching position after giving birth to her first child and stayed 
                home, before moving on to homeschooling both her children, she continued to 
                be active in teaching music to children in the homeschooling community as well
                as in her church. She is excited to come back to EVCC to teach choir again 
                and is looking forward not only teaching children vocal skills but also 
                inspiring the next generation to love music and singing.
